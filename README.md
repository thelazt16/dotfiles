WIP. I haven't really manage my dotfiles for quite sometimes. After using other people dotfiles like gh0stzk, JaKooLit, aylur, etc, I haven't really care that much about what kind of system environment I use.

After started using Hyprland with ags and fallen in love with it, I started to want to work on my own dotfiles so I don't need modify other people dotfiles before actually using it. The other reason is because when using other people dotfiles, it would mean that I ended with stuff I don't use and sometimes it causes issues which kinda annoying to deal with since I would need to know what installed and how it configured eventhough I didn't use that program ðŸ¤£. Although the upside to using other people dotfiles is I don't really need to tinker that much since it get updated quite regularly.
